<p align="center"><img src="docs/hero.png" alt="Xylocopa — Many projects. One attention." width="640"></p>

**Xylocopa is a visual orchestrator for your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agents. It keeps you focused while they do the work. Deploy it on your computer and manage your work from anywhere.**

*Named after [Xylocopa caerulea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylocopa_caerulea), the blue carpenter bee. Xylocopa (zy-LOCK-uh-puh) is Greek for "wood-cutter". If you find it useful, a star helps others find it.*

## The Loop

The workflow follows [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/), with agents as the executor.

1. **Capture.** Dump tasks into the inbox from anywhere by typing, speaking, or using quick entry.
2. **Dispatch.** One click turns a task into an agent. Agents run in parallel, each in its own git worktree, seeded with lessons from past sessions.
3. **Monitor.** The attention button always takes you to the agent that needs you. You approve plans and tool calls in chat, and notifications fire only when you're away.
4. **Review.** Approve and close, or retry. A stopped attempt is auto-summarized, so the next agent starts from that summary instead of from zero.
5. **Remember.** Lessons land in each project's `PROGRESS.md` and are retrieved for future agents. Every conversation stays searchable and resumable.

Every agent runs in a tmux session you can attach to from a terminal, and CLI sessions show up in the web app. Sync is two-way.

## Features

| Category | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Tasks & history** | Inbox with voice input, quick capture, drag-to-reorder, draft persistence; retry with auto-summarization; every conversation persisted, full-text searchable, resumable; star sessions, bookmark messages. |
| **Agent control** | Start/stop/resume; per-agent model, timeout, and permission mode; batch dispatch; lesson retrieval at dispatch; agents read each other's sessions over MCP at ~54× fewer tokens than raw JSONL. |
| **Chat** | Markdown, inline media, LaTeX; plan-review and tool-approval cards; context-usage and lifetime-cost breakdowns; double-tap a bubble to bookmark, modify, or fork ([gestures](docs/gestures.md)). |
| **Interactive artifacts** | Agents present runnable deliverables as cards. Web apps are served sandboxed and localhost services reverse-proxied (HTTP + WebSocket), with a console drawer for debugging. The screenshot above is an agent-built 3D explorer of 6,271 NASA exoplanets, in chat on an iPhone. |
| **Monitoring & notifications** | Split screen (up to 4 panes), real-time WebSocket updates, system monitor (disk, memory, GPU, tokens), weekly stats; hook-based Web Push that fires when you're away and stays quiet while you watch. |
| **Attention jobs** | Reminders, schedules, and state watchers compiled from natural language ("wake me when the GPU frees up"), combining time, interval, app-state, and webhook triggers with push-notify, message-agent, and dispatch-task actions. An experimental orb assistant manages them from a chat bubble (off by default). |
| **Web terminal & CLI sync** | An in-chat terminal attaches to the agent's live tmux session from any browser, phone included; CLI sessions appear in the web app and web sessions resume from a terminal (`tmux attach -t xy-<id>`). Sync is two-way. |
| **Mobile PWA & themes** | Home Screen install on iOS/Android with push and voice; five preset palettes (Nord, Solarized, Everforest, …) plus a custom theme editor; e-ink display mode for e-paper readers. |
| **Git** | Per-project diffs, commit history, branch status; agents work in isolated worktrees; one-click cleanup and push. |
| <a id="safety-guardrails"></a>**Security & safety** | Password auth with rate limiting, inactivity lock, HTTPS; a deterministic `PreToolUse` hook hard-blocks destructive operations (`rm -rf`, force-pushes, `git reset --hard`, `DROP TABLE`, writes outside the project) even under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. |
| **Reliability** | Survives restarts and kills, with an incremental [session cache](orchestrator/session_cache.py), tmux-anchored agent recovery, scheduled [backups](orchestrator/backup.py), [orphan cleanup](orchestrator/orphan_cleanup.py), and unlimited session retention. |

## Getting Started

You need Linux or macOS, Node.js 18+, Python 3.11+, tmux, and the Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, then run `claude` once to log in). A Claude Pro/Max subscription is enough, and Bedrock/Vertex/LiteLLM support carries over via the usual env vars. An OpenAI key is optional and only needed for voice input.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyao97/xylocopa/master/setup.sh | bash
```

The installer clones into `~/xylocopa-main`, prompts for your projects directory, default model, and ports, writes `.env` ([`.env.example`](.env.example) is the annotated reference), generates SSL certs, and starts the services. To install manually instead, clone the repo and run `./setup.sh` followed by `./run.sh start`. Open `https://<machine-ip>:3000` and set a password on first visit.

- **Add projects.** Long-press **+** to open the **New Project** form, then paste a GitHub URL or point at a folder. Folders in `~/xylocopa-projects/` are picked up automatically.
- **Auto-start on reboot.** Run `./run.sh startup`, which registers pm2 with your init system and detaches it from the terminal's cgroup, so closing the terminal doesn't kill the services.
- <a id="remote-access"></a>**Remote access.** Any VPN or tunnel works. With Tailscale, run `tailscale up` on the server and your phone, then open `https://<tailscale-ip>:3000`. No ports are exposed to the internet.
- **Phone install.** Open the URL in Safari or Chrome and follow the on-screen guide to trust the self-signed certificate and add the app to your Home Screen ([per-platform cert steps](docs/install-cert.md)).
- **Your data.** The SQLite DB lives in the install directory, sessions are Claude Code's native JSONL under `~/.claude/projects/` (not duplicated), and lessons live in each repo's `PROGRESS.md`. Uninstalling is one `pm2 delete` plus a few `rm -rf`s ([details](docs/uninstall.md)).

Symlink the Xylocopa repo itself into `~/xylocopa-projects/` and agents can improve the tool while you use it.

## Agent control plane

Agents call back into the orchestrator through a built-in MCP server that lets them list and create tasks, dispatch work, read other agents' sessions, scaffold projects, and present web apps. The surface is restricted to non-destructive verbs. Probes are the event-driven part. An agent registers a one-shot webhook ("wake me when CI on PR #42 goes green") and hands the URL to whatever monitors the condition. POSTing it injects a message into the chat. The full tool list and safety model are in [docs/agent-mcp-tools.md](docs/agent-mcp-tools.md).

## Telemetry

One anonymous event per day, containing a random install id, version, platform, and timestamp. Nothing user-generated, no IPs, no prompts, no paths. Sent by [`telemetry.py`](orchestrator/telemetry.py) to a [Cloudflare Worker](https://github.com/jyao97/xylocopa-telemetry) owned by the author, with no third-party analytics. Disable it with the toggle in **Monitor → Help improve Xylocopa** or `XYLOCOPA_TELEMETRY=0`.
