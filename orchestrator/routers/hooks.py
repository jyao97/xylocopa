    Two-phase strategy:

    1. **Fixed 150ms sleep** (JSONL_FLUSH_DELAY) — covers the common case
       where CC flushes within this window. After the sleep, check the
       new bytes appended since the *baseline at function entry*:
       - ``wait_for=None``  → any growth counts (legacy any-grew judgement).
       - ``wait_for=bytes`` → only return True if the marker is in the new
         bytes (semantic judgement; eliminates the Stop-hook race where
         Phase 1 fires on a late-flushed assistant entry instead of the
         actual ``stop_hook_summary`` we are waiting for).

    2. **Watchdog loop** — if Phase 1 didn't detect the marker, install
       a watchdog listener and re-check after each modify event, until
       the marker appears or the remaining budget is spent. The loop
       (vs the original one-shot) matters under ``wait_for=bytes``:
       an unrelated entry can wake the watchdog before the marker lands.

    Why baseline is "size at function entry" and NOT ctx.last_offset:
    unrelated housekeeping writes (e.g. earlier PreToolUse attachments)
    that happened between the last sync and the current hook would inflate
    a last_offset-based check, causing a false-positive "flush observed"
    that misses the actual content we're waiting for.

    Also briefly polls for the sync context to be installed — at
    SessionStart, the launch task races with this hook to register ctx.
